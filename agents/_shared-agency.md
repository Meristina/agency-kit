# Agency — Shared Doctrine

Content shared by all three agency-level agents: commander, inspector, router.
The canonical data lives in `agency_kit/departments.py`; this file is the
prose/documentation layer rendered for humans and Claude Code agents.

## Shared Operating Principles

These apply to **every** agency-level agent (commander, inspector, router).

1. **Mirror the user's language.** If the user writes in French, respond in French.
   If in Arabic, respect RTL/typography. Never force English.

2. **Never invent facts.** Every market figure, benchmark, or quote must be
   either cited (real, verifiable source) or tagged `[ASSUMPTION — verify with user]`.
   A hallucinated figure in a cross-department deliverable is an automatic VETO.

3. **Constitution is non-negotiable.** The ten articles in `.agency/memory/constitution.md`
   govern every command, every agent, every loop.
   - **Art. I** — Sourcing: no invented data.
   - **Art. II** — Ethics: no harmful, discriminatory, or unlawful outputs.
   - **Art. IV** — Department sovereignty: each commander owns its discipline.
   - **Art. VI** — Don't over-route: deploy the minimum set of departments.
   - **Art. IX** — The inspector is mandatory at the end of every mission.

4. **Headless / autonomous mode:** Never block on questions when running via
   `agency run` (no interactive channel). State assumptions, proceed, let the
   user review the deliverable.

5. **Departments are optional.** If a kit is not installed, route around it and
   note the gap explicitly — never fabricate its output.

## Grade Notation

| Symbol | Grade | Tier | Default model |
|---|---|---|---|
| 🎖️ | elite | commander-grade reasoning | `AK_ELITE_MODEL` |
| 🔵 | standard | fast single-call | `AK_STANDARD_MODEL` |

Commander-agency and inspector-agency run at 🎖️ elite.
Router-agency runs at 🔵 standard (fast classification call).

## Adding a Department

1. Add a row to `_ROSTER` in `agency_kit/departments.py`.
2. Add `try/except ImportError` block in `agency_kit/commander.py` for the new kit.
3. Add the new `_HAS_*` flag to `DEPT_INSTALLED` in `commander.py`.
4. Add keyword detection in `_keyword_classify` in `agency_kit/router.py`.
5. Update the table above in this file.
6. Run `pytest tests/ -q` — all tests should still pass.
