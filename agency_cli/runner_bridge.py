    missions/<id>/ copy. Shared by run() and resume() so both persist identically.

    `on_event` is an optional observational progress callback threaded straight
    through to `run_mission_cli` (used by the Studio server to stream SSE). Default
    None ⇒ unchanged behaviour.

    `should_cancel` is an optional cooperative-cancel predicate. When it fires,
    `run_mission_cli` raises `MissionCancelled` BEFORE returning — so the store.save
    and serialize_dossier below never run, and a cancelled mission leaves no trace.

    `asset_clause` / `render_assets` are the Studio's multimodal hook (default None
    ⇒ unchanged). `asset_clause` is threaded to `run_mission_cli` (it lets a
    department/synthesis emit fenced `asset` markers). `render_assets` is invoked
    AFTER the engine returns but BEFORE persistence, so both the store copy and the
    serialized missions/<id>/ copy carry the manifest it writes into
    `dossier['assets']` (and the cosmetic rewrite it makes to `dossier['delivered']`).
    It is gated strictly on a clean Inspector PASS and is best-effort.

    `context_clause` is the Studio's Wave-4 RAG hook — sourced excerpts from the user's
    uploaded documents, threaded to `run_mission_cli` and appended to the department +
    synthesis prompts. Default None ⇒ unchanged; same additive contract as `asset_clause`.

    `mcp_config_path` / `mcp_allowed_tools` are the Studio's Wave-6 MCP tool-calling hook —
    a `--mcp-config` file (built from the user's MCP servers) and the `mcp__*` tools to allow,
    threaded to `run_mission_cli` so departments + synthesis can invoke those tools. Default
    None ⇒ unchanged; same additive contract as `context_clause`.

    `persona_doctrine` is the Studio's Wave-6 persona-doctrine hook — a dict keyed by
    department (+ the reserved `"commander"` key) → a curated persona string, threaded to
    `run_mission_cli` where it augments the DEPARTMENT DOCTRINE (departments) and commander
    doctrine (synthesis) prompt text only. Default None ⇒ unchanged; same additive contract.

    `on_checkpoint` / `resume_state` are the Studio's crash-recovery hook — an observational
    snapshot callback fired at each phase boundary, and a prior snapshot to resume an interrupted
    mission from mid-flight (skip routing + completed departments, re-enter the veto loop at the
    saved iteration). Threaded straight to `run_mission_cli`. Default None ⇒ unchanged. Note a
    resumed mission persists under a FRESH mission_id (line below) exactly like a first run — the
    checkpoint is transient crash-recovery, not the durable dossier.
